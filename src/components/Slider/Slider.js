              It's not always a good idea to try DIY couples counseling. In some
              cases, it can be destructiveâ€”even dangerous. ... Getting both
              individual and couples counseling at the same time is sometimes
              the best approach, but couples counseling rarely works as the only
              treatment for individual issues.
